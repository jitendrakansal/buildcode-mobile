    ![MDK](images/1.1.5.png) 

    >SAP Build Code recommends the dev space it deems most suitable, and it will automatically create a new one for you if you don't already have one. If you have other dev spaces of the Mobile Application type, you can select between them.

6. Your project is being created in the Project table of the lobby. The creation of the project may take a few moments. After the project has been created successfully, click the project to open it. 
   
    ![MDK](images/1.1.6.png) 

    The project opens in SAP Build Code development environment.

### Exercise 2.2 - Configure the Application Using Storyboard 

The Storyboard provides a graphical view of the application's runtime resources, external resources, UI of the application, and the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the applicationâ€™s structure and components.

- **Runtime Resources**: In the Runtime Resources section, you can see the mobile services application and mobile destination used in the project, with a dotted-line connected to the External Resources.
- **External Resources**: In the External Resources section, you can see the external services used in the project, with a dotted-line connection to the Runtime Resource or the UI app.
- **UI Application**: In the UI Applications section, you can see the mobile applications.

1. Click on **+** button in the **Runtime Resources** column to add a mobile services app to your project. 

    ![MDK](images/1.2.1.png) 

2. Sign in to your Cloud Foundry account and select the Org and Space in which you would like to create your mobile services app. Click on **Open a new browser page to generate your SSO passcode** to generate an SSO passcode.

    ![MDK](images/1.2.2.png) 

3. Click on **Sign in with default identity provider**. 

    ![MDK](images/1.2.3.png) 

4. Copy the Temporary Authentication Code, switch back to SAP Business Application Studio tab, paste the code into the **Enter your SSO Passcode** field, and click on **Sign In**.

    ![MDK](images/1.2.9.png) 

    >You can access the mobile services admin UI by clicking on the Mobile Services option on the right hand side. 

    In the storyboard window, the app and mobile destination will be added under the Runtime Resources column. The mobile destination will also be added under the External Resources with a dotted-line connection to the Runtime Resource. The External Resource will be used to create the UI application.

    ![MDK](images/1.2.10.png) 

9. Click the **+** button in the UI application column header to add mobile UI for your project.

    ![MDK](images/1.2.11.png) 

10. Select the **MDK Template Type** as **CRUD**, leave the other options as they are, and click **Next**.

    ![MDK](images/1.2.12.png) 

    >Since you have Enable Offline set to *Yes*, the generated application will be offline enabled. 

11. In the **Data Collections** step, provide the below information and click **Finish**:

    | Field | Value |
    |----|----|
    | `Enter a path to service (e.g. /sap/opu/odata/sap/SERVICE_NAME)` | Leave it as it is  |
    | `Select the Service Type` | Leave the default value as `OData` |
    | `Enable Offline` | It's enabled by default |
